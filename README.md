# ImputeBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Time Series Imputation Techniques

ImputeBench implements over 15 advanced imputation techniques for missing blocks in time series. It evaluates their precision and runtime on various real-world time series datasets using different recovery scenarios. Technical details can be found in our PVLDB 2020 paper: <a href = "http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p768-khayati.pdf">Mind the Gap: An Experimental Evaluation of Imputation of Missing Values Techniques in Time Series </a>. The benchmark can be easily extended with new algorithms (C/C++, Python, or Matlab), datasets, and scenarios.

### Results

All results and plots will be added to the `Results` folder. The accuracy results of all algorithms will be sequentially added for each scenario and dataset to: `Results/.../.../error/`. The runtime results of all algorithms will be added to: `Results/.../.../runtime/`. The plots of the recovered blocks will be added to the folder `Results/.../.../recovery/plots/`.

### Execution examples

1. Run a single algorithm (cdrec) on a single dataset (drift10) using one scenario (missing percentage)

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg cdrec -d drift10 -scen miss_perc
```

2. Run two algorithms (cdrec, spirit) on a single dataset (drift10) using one scenario (missing percentage)

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg cdrec,spirit -d drift10 -scen miss_perc
```

3. Run point 2 without runtime results

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg cdrec,spirit -d drift10 -scen miss_perc -nort
```

4. Run the whole VLDB'20 benchmark (all algorithms, all datasets, all scenarios, precision and runtime)

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg all -d all -scen all
```

**Warning**: Running the whole benchmark takes a sizeable amount of time (up to 4 days, depending on the hardware) and produces up to 15GB of output files with all recovered data and plots unless stopped early.

5. Create patterns of missing blocks on one complete dataset (airq) using one scenario (missing percentage)

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg mvexport -d airq -scen miss_perc
```

**Note**: You must run each scenario separately on one or multiple datasets. Each time you execute one scenario, the `Results` folder will be overwritten with the new files.

6. Additional command-line parameters

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe --help
```

### Parametrized execution

- You can parametrize each algorithm using the command `-algx`. For example, you can run
  the svdimp algorithm with a reduction value of 4 on the drift dataset and by varying the sequence length as follows:

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -algx svdimp 4 -d drift10 -scen ts_nbr
```

- If you want to run some algorithms with default parameters and some with customized ones, you can use `-alg` and `-algx` together. For example, you can run stmvl algorithm with default parameter and cdrec algorithm with a reduction value of 4 on the airq dataset by varying the sequence length as follows:

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg stmvl -algx cdrec 4 -d airq -scen ts_nbr
```

**Remark**: The command `-algx` cannot be executed in a group and thus must precede the name of each algorithm.

## Executing New Algorithms


- To evaluate the newly integrated algorithms, please install the following Python packages (takes several minutes):

```bash
    $ sh install_extra.sh
```

- Activate the virtual environment and execute the new algorithms from the table above

```bash
    $ source bench-env/bin/activate
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe [arguments]
```

- To add new datasets:
  - import the file to `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/{name}/{name}_normal.txt` (`name` is the name of your dataset).
  - **Requirements**: rows>= 1'000, columns>= 10, column separator: empty space, row separator: newline
  - **Note**: the benchmark can also run with rows>= 100 and columns>= 5 but with a limited number of scenarios and algorithms.
